## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @epistoteles
I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Intelligent Adaptive Systems at the University of Hamburg, which I will finish in 2023. In the past, I have interned at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto and MOIA, a ridesharing startup based in Hamburg.
